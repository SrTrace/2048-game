# 2048 Game

This project is a JavaScript implementation of the popular game 2048. In this game, players combine tiles of the same number to reach the tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where each move slides all tiles in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). When two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they merge into a tile with the total of their numbers. The goal is to create a tile with the number 2048.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The main language used for the game logic, including classes and modules.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the game interface.
